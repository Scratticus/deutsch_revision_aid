# deutsch_revision_aid
A repository holding an engineered prompt to guide German revision

First upload at Ver 4.1 for user tests.

Key issues:
- Agent Marks results incorrectly and must be guided to verify its scoring
- question formats do not vary.
- topic selection logic needs refinement

# How to Use
Step 1: 
  Initial Diagnostic - Copy the entire prompt into a new Claude.ai agent conversation. 
    The Claude Agent will assess your level of German ability and generate a bespoke prompt with your recorded ability levels.
Step 2: 
  Ongoing Revision Sessions - Open a new chat, or initialise a new Claude Agent and paste your bespoke prompt there. 
    The Agent will identify a core weakness, an item that needs strengthening at your ability level or start a new topic for you to learn
    At the end of the session it will provide you an updated prompt to use for your next session.
Step 3:
  Repeat until Mastery is achieved.

Re-initialising your prompt: Start over with the latest updated prompt provided here.

Due to ongoing issues with agent accuracy, the bot may require extra prompting to verify the accuracy of its diagnostic scores, this is known and under revision.

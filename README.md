# deutsch_revision_aid
A repository holding an engineered prompt to guide German revision

First upload at Ver 4.1 for user tests.

Key issues:
- Agent Marks results incorrectly and must be guided to verify its scoring
- question formats do not vary.
- topic selection logic needs refinement

# How to Use
Simply copy the entire prompt into a new Claude.ai agent conversation. The prompt should assess your level of German ability and generate a bespoke prompt to guide your revision sessions.
Each prompt should be pasted into a new conversation.
Due to ongoing issues with agent accuracy, the bot may require extra prompting to verify the accuracy of its diagnostic scores.
